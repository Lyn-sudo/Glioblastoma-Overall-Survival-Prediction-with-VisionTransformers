Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a median survival of 10â€“15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes.

In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Our method leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract meaningful features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need for manual or automated tumor segmentation.

Unlike traditional approaches, our method:

  - Simplifies the processing workflow

  - Reduces the need for computational resources

  - Maintains strong predictive performance
